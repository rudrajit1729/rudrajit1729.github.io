Unlike when people search on the Internet to be aware of the latest news or current temperature, a distinctly informational activity [60], programmers routinely search for source code on the Internet [13, 68, 72] when they are looking for solutions to aid in their current programming problem [19]. Sometimes the programmer uses a search engine to find one specific code snippet. For example, the programmer might need to remember how to write a few lines of code (e.g., the code to open a database in PHP) [15, 25]. Other times, the programmer uses a search engine when she is not quite sure what she is searching for and there is not exactly one code snippet she has in mind. For example, the programmer might need to learn a concept [15, 66], such as database transactions, and needs to look at multiple examples illustrating different aspects of databases and alternative examples to clarify her understanding [15, 25, 36, 61, 66]. For another example, the programmer might need to get ideas [72], such as when designing a new game and wants to see, and sometimes compare [25], how other code handles game characters, board state, or visualization.
