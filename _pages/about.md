<div style="text-align: justify;">
  I’m Rudrajit (Rudy), a fourth-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/EECS">Oregon State University</a>, advised by <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~sarmaa/">Dr. Anita Sarma</a>. My research lies at the intersections of Human-Centered AI (HCAI), Software Engineering (SE), Cognitive Science, UX Design, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Currently, I study (1) <strong><em>cognitive processes that influence human-AI interactions in SE</em></strong>, and (2) <strong><em>methods for designing human-centered interfaces for AI tools to improve user-experiences in AI-assisted software development.</em></strong> 

  <br><br>
  My goal is to empower developers and end-users with trustworthy, effective, and inclusive AI support, enabling them to work more efficiently, maintain control over AI, and minimize errors.
  <br><br>
  I am grateful to have been mentored by incredible researchers who have shaped my journey: <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~sarmaa/">Anita Sarma</a> and <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/">Margaret Burnett</a> for SE+HCAI, <a href="https://www.igor.pro.br/">Igor Steinmacher</a> and <a href="https://biancatrink.github.io/">Bianca Trinkenreich</a> for SE, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/casanchezphd">Christopher Sanchez</a> for Cognitive Psychology, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cbird/">Christian Bird</a> and <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/~gerosa/">Marco Gerosa</a> for SE+AI.
