I’m Daye Nam and I'm a Software Engineering Ph.D. student at the [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am co-advised by [Brad Myers](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/), [Bogdan Vasilescu](https://bvasiles.github.io/), and [Vincent Hellendoorn](http://vhellendoorn.github.io/). I am also a member of the [Natural Programming Group](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/index.html), [STRUDEL](https://cmustrudel.github.io/), and [IPSUM Lab](https://ipsum-lab.github.io/).

I design, build, and evaluate AI tools for developers using NLP techniques, while prioritizing the usefulness and usability of the AI tools. More specifically, I (1) conduct empirical studies to understand developers’ needs, (2) build and train machine learning models based on the insights gained from the studies, (3) use the resulting models to build tools for developers, and (4) evaluate them using HCI methods.

Prior to joining CMU, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science from [University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), where I worked in the [Software Architecture Research Lab](https://softarch.usc.edu/) under the guidance of [Nenad Medvidović](https://softarch.usc.edu/~neno/). I received my Bachelor's degree at [Yonsei University](https://cs.yonsei.ac.kr:59290/eng/index.php) in Computer Science.
