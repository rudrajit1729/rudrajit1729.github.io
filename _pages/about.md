I will begin as an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Irvine, in Fall 2025. Currently, I am a visiting researcher at Google, working with [Satish Chandra](https://sites.google.com/site/schandraacmorg/). I completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University in May 2024. At CMU, I was fortunate to be advised by [Brad Myers](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/), [Bogdan Vasilescu](https://bvasiles.github.io/), and [Vincent Hellendoorn](http://vhellendoorn.github.io/). I received my M.S. degree from the University of Southern California, and B.S. degree from Yonsei University.

My research focuses on designing, building, and evaluating AI tools for developers, with a strong emphasis on making these tools useful and usable. My ultimate goal is to empower programmers at all levels to write programs effectively and with greater control, aided by AI.

**Prospective students**: I am actively seeking motivated students with strong backgrounds in software engineering, human-computer interaction, and/or natural language processing. If you are interested in working with me, [apply to the program](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/admissions/graduate-application-process/) and mention me as the faculty member of interest. Feel free to email me your CV and a brief description of your research interests as well.
