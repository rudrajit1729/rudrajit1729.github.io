I’m Daye Nam and I'm a Software Engineering Ph.D. student at the [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am co-advised by [Brad Myers](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/), [Bogdan Vasilescu](https://bvasiles.github.io/), and [Vincent Hellendoorn](http://vhellendoorn.github.io/). I am also a member of the [Natural Programming Group](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/index.html), [STRUDEL](https://cmustrudel.github.io/), and [IPSUM Lab](https://ipsum-lab.github.io/).

I do research at the intersection of Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Human Computer Interaction, to improve [API usability](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/papers/p62-myers-CACM-API_Usability.pdf). Specifically, my research develops methods and tools for 1) API designers to detect and summarize API usability issues, and 2) programmers to learn and use APIs efficiently and correctly.

Prior to joining CMU, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science from [University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), where I worked in the [Software Architecture Research Lab](https://softarch.usc.edu/) under the guidance of [Nenad Medvidović](https://softarch.usc.edu/~neno/). I received my Bachelor's degree at [Yonsei University](https://cs.yonsei.ac.kr:59290/eng/index.php) in Computer Science.
