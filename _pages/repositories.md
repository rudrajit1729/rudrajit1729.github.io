<p> <strong>Areas of Interest</strong>: Human-Computer/AI Interaction (HCI/HAI), Cognitive Science, AI, UX Design, Software Engineering (SE) </p>


<div style="text-align: justify;">

My research investigates <strong>socio-technical and cognitive aspects of human-AI collaboration in software development</strong>. I conduct <em> empirical studies to understand how developers write software and engage with AI (where, why, and how they seek or limit support)</em>, <em>design human-centered tools and interfaces to enhance user experiences and productivity in AI-driven workflows</em>, and <em>evaluate these interventions through formative and summative studies</em>.  Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, I draw from design and visualization, AI, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction to make AI-assisted knowledge work more human-centered.

<br><br>
I also focus on empowering students to be AI-savvy through interface and curricula design; positioning AI as a cognitive collaborator, adding verification and metacognitive scaffolds to curb over-reliance and promote reflection, and leveraging AI as a tool for thought.

My **current projects** include:  

- Trust, Transparency, and Alignment in Human-AI Collaboration 
- Human-AI Teaming in Software Development
- Work Design for the AI Era: Safeguarding Agency, Craft, and Meaningful Work
- Cognitive Impacts of AI in CS Education
- Inclusive UX: Cognitive & Socio-economic aware HCI
