<p> <strong>Areas of Interest</strong>: Human-Computer/AI Interaction (HCI/HAI), Cognitive Science, AI, Inclusive Design, Software Engineering (SE) </p>


<div style="text-align: justify;">

My research investigates the <strong>socio-technical and cognitive aspects of human-AI collaboration in software development</strong>. I conduct <em> empirical studies to understand how developers engage with AI</em>, <em>design human-centered tools and interfaces to enhance user experience in AI-assisted software engineering (SE)</em>, and <em>evaluate these interventions through formative and summative studies</em>.  Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, I draw from software engineering, design and visualization, AI, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction to make AI-assisted SE more human-centered.

I also focus on empowering developer teams by creating tools to enhance productivity, reduce cognitive load & technostress, and foster inclusive user experiences (UX) in AI-driven workflows.

- Trust and Alignment in Human-AI Interaction 
- AI Governance for SE
- Cognitive Impacts of AI in SE
- Effects of Human-AI Teaming in Software Development
- Inclusive UX: Cognitive & Socio-economic aware HCI
